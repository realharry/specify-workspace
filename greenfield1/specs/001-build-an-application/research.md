# Research for Photo Organization Application

This document outlines the research needed to resolve the open questions in the implementation plan.

## 1. Testing Framework

**Question:** What testing framework should be used for this project?

**Options:**
-   Jest
-   Mocha
-   Vitest
-   Other

**Decision:** Vitest
**Rationale:** Integrates well with Vite, which is already a project dependency. It's a modern testing framework with a good developer experience.

## 2. Performance Goals

**Question:** What are the performance goals for the application?

**Examples:**
-   Album loading time: < 500ms
-   Image thumbnail rendering time: < 100ms
-   UI responsiveness: 60fps during drag-and-drop operations

**Decision:** The example values will be adopted as the performance goals.
**Rationale:** These are reasonable performance targets for a local desktop application and provide a good user experience.

## 3. Scale and Scope

**Question:** What is the expected scale and scope of the application?

**Examples:**
-   Maximum number of photos: 10,000
-   Maximum number of albums: 1,000
-   Expected number of concurrent users: 1 (as it's a local application)

**Decision:** The example values will be adopted for the scale and scope.
**Rationale:** These values provide a clear scope for the initial version of the application and are suitable for a local photo organizer.
