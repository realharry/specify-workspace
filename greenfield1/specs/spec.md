# Feature Specification: Photo Organization Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`
**Created**: 2025-09-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can help me organize my photos in separate photo albums. Albums are grouped by date and can be re-organized by dragging and dropping on the main page. Albums never other nested albums. Within each album, photos are previewed in a tile-like interface."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to organize my photos into albums based on date so that I can easily find and view them. I want to be able to rearrange the albums on the main page by dragging and dropping them. Inside each album, I want to see my photos as a grid of thumbnails.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a collection of photos, **When** I create a new album, **Then** the album is created and grouped by date on the main page.
2. **Given** an existing album, **When** I drag and drop it to a new position on the main page, **Then** the album's position is updated.
3. **Given** an album with photos, **When** I open the album, **Then** I see a tile-like interface of photo previews.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to create an album with no photos?
- What happens when a user tries to drag an album on top of another album?
- How does the system handle photos with missing date information?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create photo albums.
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically group albums by date on the main page.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to re-organize albums on the main page using drag and drop.
- **FR-004**: System MUST prevent albums from being nested within other albums.
- **FR-005**: System MUST display photos within an album in a tile-like interface.
- **FR-006**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How are photos added to the application? Upload, import from a folder, etc.?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What metadata is associated with a photo? e.g., name, date, location]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Photo**: Represents a single image file. Attributes include the image data itself, a date, and potentially other metadata.
- **Album**: Represents a collection of photos. Attributes include a name (or date-based title) and a list of associated photos.
